It gives you a clear picture of your immune strengths, weaknesses, and where support is most needed.By testing a set of reliable clinical biomarkers, we assess how well your body detects threats, controls inflammation, and stays in immune balance. Whether you're facing frequent illnesses, slow healing, autoimmune issues, or aiming to strengthen your natural defenses, this evaluation reveals how your immune system is functioning and where improvement is possible.",
